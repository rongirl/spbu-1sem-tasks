Well the morning was complete.
There was tears on the steering wheel dripping on the seat,
Several hours or several weeks,
I'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak!

It's the beginning of the end, the car went up the hill,
And disappeared around the bend, ask anyone they'll tell you that.
It's these times that it tends,
The start to breaking up, to start to fall apart
Oh! hold on to your heart.

Do me a favour and break my nose!
Do me a favour and tell me to go away!
Do me a favour and stop asking questions!

She walked away, well her shoes were untied,
And the eyes were all red,
You could see that we'd cried, and I watched and I waited,
'Till she was inside, forcing a smile and waving goodbye.

Curiousity becomes a heavy load,
Too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold.
Curiousity becomes a heavy load,
Too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold.

And do me a favour, and ask if you need some help!
She said, do me a favour and stop flattering yourself!
How to tear apart the ties that bind, perhaps might be too kind,
Perhaps might be too kind

Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift
The type that sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think
Of you somehow and I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep
Spilling drinks on my settee

(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways
(Sad to see you go)
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(Baby we both know)
That the nights were mainly made
For saying things that you can't say
Tomorrow day

Crawling back to you

Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too busy being yours
To fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through

Crawling back to you

So have you got the guts?
Been wondering if your heart's still open
And if so I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down and pucker up
I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp
Of trying to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways
(Sad to see you go)
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(Baby we both know)
That the nights were mainly made
For saying things that you can't say
Tomorrow day

Crawling back to you (crawling back to you)

Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
(you've had a few)
'Cause I always do ('cause I always do)
Maybe I'm too (maybe I'm too busy)
Busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through

Crawling back to you

(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways
(Sad to see you go)
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(Baby we both know)
That the nights were mainly made
For saying things that you can't say
Tomorrow day

(Do I wanna know?)
Too busy being yours to fall
(Sad to see you go)
Ever thought of calling darling?
(Do I wanna know?)
Do you want me crawling back to you?
